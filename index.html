        <h2>What kind of issues do the customers refer&nbsp;to&nbsp;me?</h2>
        <p>At the present time the founders of startups usually contact me at the stage of compilation of idea of ​​their product. The founders are usually aware of the problem their future users have and have an idea of ​​how their startup would solve this problem. However, usually the founders who contact me do not have a clearly formulated technical assignment and the understanding of features, which need to be implemented to launch the project, and how the development process should be organized.</p>
        <h2>Advantages of cooperation with me&nbsp;and&nbsp;my&nbsp;team</h2>
        <div class="advantages">
          <div class="advantage">Owing to the weekly demo presentations you will have the opportunity to observe and control the process of development.</div>
          <div class="advantage">You will always have access to the latest version of the operational product, so that even before the completion of development you can demonstrate the product to your potential customers and other interested persons and receive their feedback.</div>
          <div class="advantage">Besides, you will have a single point of communication with the team through the team leader and you will not have to delve into the work of different specialists.</div>
          <div class="advantage">By necessity you can always make adjustments to the original plan of development, since the code architecture allows introduction of any modifications.</div>
          <div class="advantage">Your product will be developed using an architecture that simultaneously allows you to quickly release the first version, and at the same time be able to scale it up endlessly in the future.</div>
          <div class="advantage">You can formulate the tasks in a simple language, and we will independently adapt them to development.</div>
          <div class="advantage">The development will not be expanded in time, as at the beginning of cooperation the time frame will be determined with an accuracy of more than 80%.</div>
          <div class="advantage">You will get an approach to the project not only from developers, but also from businessmen, since we have our own startups either.</div>
          <div class="advantage">After the development is completed, our team always stays in touch, and we are ready to return to the further development of the project at any moment in time.</div>
          <div class="advantage">If necessary, I am ready to hand over the code that we created to your internal team of development, which can easily maintain and enhance it in the future.</div>
          <div class="advantage">In online mode, you and your team can see the code of my current projects in order to assess my technical level.</div>
          <div class="advantage">You will save money and time due to the fact that I use architecture and the technology stack, aimed at minimizing the losses of time and money.</div>

It’s a cheaper, faster, and more comfortable mode of development for all parties, but it requires a mutual trust. I propose to introduce this scheme after the first month of cooperation.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>In the first conversation with the founder of a startup I find out his current vision of the project. Then I usually create a graphic prototype (a draft) of the future service so that we can make sure that the vision of the product in my head is in synchronized with the vision of the founder of the product. This prototype acts as a technical specification both for me, as a developer, and for the designer, whom I also involve in the work at the very beginning of the project.</p>
        <p>While the design is being done, I am engaged in the technical implementation of a mobile application or a web service, demonstrating the intermediate results of work every week. As soon as the design is ready, I will stretch it over the technical implementation that has already begun.</p>
        <p>After some period of time (usually 3-6 months are enough to launch the first version), we will launch the product and will be able to attract the first users. Further, we will receive a feedback from users and will continue the development, constantly developing and scaling up the product.</p>
        <p>In the project I act as a full stack JavaScript developer and a team lead. I am responsible for the entire technical part of the product. At first I work alone, later I usually attract additional 1-2 full-stack developers to speed up the development. Besides, at the beginning of the project I involve a UX designer in the project so that the final product would become as attractive as possible for its users. My partner Aleksey helps me communicate with the client and deal with the legal issues so that I can pay more attention to the development of the project itself.</p>
        <h2>Technologies</h2>
        <p>In course of development we use React, Apollo, Node.js, MongoDB and Figma to create the design. I have made a lot of projects on these technologies and I have formed my own approach that allows creating products quickly, easily maintaining and scaling up the code and minimizing eventual bugs. In online mode you and your team will be able to see the code of my current projects in order to assess my technical level.</p>

        <h2 id="9-questions">9 questions to ask yourself before starting development of a startup</h2>
        <p>I have prepared for you the answers to 9 questions that you need to ask yourself before starting developing a startup:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>How should one choose a technology stack?</li>
          <li>Should you hire a full-stack developer or a front-end and a back-end engineers in separate?</li>
          <li>Should you you work with Agile or Waterfall?</li>
          <li>How much should you pay the developers?</li>
          <li>Is it worth hiring a developer for a share in the project?</li>
          <li>How can you verify the competence of developer?</li>
          <li>What should you provide to developer before start of works?</li>
          <li>How can you control the developers?</li>
          <li>How will the startup development process be structured?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To receive a file with questions and answers, add me as a friend on Facebook or LinkedIn and write the code phrase "9 questions" in the private messages.</p>
